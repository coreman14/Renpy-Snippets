## To-do List
- [I] Better API validation. Ignoring due to the hole I dug myself in with a single component for 2 form actions + how do you bind it after?
- [X] Button that makes the current user only able to see their snippets in the browse page
- [X] Add some comforts to the file text area (Tab should insert up to 4 spaces to match indents + auto space when : at end of line)
- [X] Search bar.
- [X] Home page.
- [X] Add syntax highlighting in view page.
- [X] Finish CSS on pages. ~~Create/edit, view and top bar of browse page and make layout search nicer~~
- [X] Add code search. Search bar on browse that specifically searches code files (name and code)
- [X] Make view/create page able to scroll filenames if too many
- [X] Add grid view for Recent and Browse
- [X] Additional pages: Author page (By clicking on the author name you can go to a page that only has that authors snips), Category page (Same thing as the author)
- [ ] Add download button that gives the project back as proper files in a zip
- [ ] Add user should be able to start an edit of the snippet from the view page
- [ ] Fix Readme

## Future possible upgrades
- [ ] Add import button. It takes a zip folder and adds every RPY it could find to the project.
- [ ] Populate a filter tab that loads all tags/categories/authors, the works
- [ ] Add some sort of suspense/loading state to the edit/create form and the delete button
- [ ] If user gives an author name, save it in local storage and autofill the create page
- [ ] Add Discord embed. I don't know how they work, but it would be cool to have it show all pages
- [ ] Resource files (Images, music that I will compress to hell and back)
