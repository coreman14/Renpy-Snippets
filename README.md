## To-do List
- [I] Better API validation. Ignoring due to the hole I dug myself in with a single component for 2 form actions + how do you bind it after?
- [X] Button that makes the current user only able to see their snippets in the browse page
- [X] Add some comforts to the file text area (Tab should insert up to 4 spaces to match indents + auto space when : at end of line)
- [X] Search bar. On browse page → Filter results, Any other page → switch to browse page with results filtered. Will add second search bar under advanced search to look in more places
- [ ] Second view for browse page that contains more info + Make the first view better (CSS starts here)
- [ ] Home page
- [ ] Populate a filter tab that loads all tags/categories/authors, the works
- [ ] Implement the syntax highlighter. You can't edit directly in a syntax highlight, so we have to do some weird CSS tricks or something.
- [ ] Add some sort of suspense/loading state to the edit/create form and the delete button
- [ ] Add download button that gives the project back as proper files in a zip
- [ ] Add Discord embed. I don't know how they work, but it would be cool to have it show all pages
